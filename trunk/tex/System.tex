\subsection{Hardware implementation}

In order to explore back-of-device touch input on tablets we created
our hardware prototype using a Stantum Slate PC and a Stantum
multitouch panel [Figure 2]. We affixed the multitouch panel to the
back of the Slate PC, appoximating a tablet with a back-of-device
touch input. The user can hold the device with both hands wrapped
around the sides, with their fingers touching the back.  Cursors
appear as semi-transparent circles on the screen directly above the
point that the user touches on the back. This helps users keep track
of their finger movement (Figure~\ref{fig:natural}).

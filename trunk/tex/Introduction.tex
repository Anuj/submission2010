\section{Introduction}

With an estimated 4 billion units in use in December 2008, mobile
devices have already become the most popular computing device in human
history. Their portability and communication capabilities have
revolutionized how people interact with each other. Despite the rapid
growth of mobile phones, text entry on mobile devices remains a major
challenge. However, with the recent rise in sales in the
smartphone/PDA market and the recent launch of serveral tablet
form-factor devices, users have greater access to medium sized touch
screens. These screens offer more screen space than a traditional
phone, and can arguably be more effective in text-input
tasks. However, due to increased size and weight, these devices
require specific postures from the users to be able to input text.

Moreover, the tablet form-factor introduces two problems for the user.
First, since a tablet is very portable, it is an ideal device for use
while mobile (e.g. actually moving, rather than nomadic, meaning in
different places, but mostly stationary).  Doctors in a busy hospital,
commuters standing on a train and TV producers on location at a shoot
are all examples of users who would benefit from using a computing
device while standing, walking or sitting and briefly holding their
device.

    \label{fig:device_hold}
\end{figure}

Unlike a mobile phone, however, a larger (e.g. 7+ inches wide)
keyboard (soft or otherwise) does not work well with two thumbs
because of the relatively large distance that the thumbs must travel
to reach the appropriate keys, and the weight of the device compounds
the problem of typing by straining the hands to support the device
while making precise movements to position the thumbs over the proper
keys. While standing, many users resort to a different pose, in which
one arm supports the device while the other hand types with a single
finger (Figure~\ref{fig:device_hold}).

A second difficulty, common to all soft keyboards, arises because the
fingers do not receive any tactile feedback as to their position on
the keyboard.  Unlike a physical keyboard in which the keys have
ridges that delineate their boundaries, a soft keyboard often requires
the user to look at the keyboard to ensure that they are activating
the correct keys.  Looking at the keys while typing is distracting,
requires many eye shifts (since the user must also verify on the
screen that what they are typing is correct).  This can be alleviated
to some extent by providing haptic feedback when a key is activated,
but this provides only limited improvement.

Recently, there has been a push in the industry for devices with
backside input. Notion ink's Adam PC has a backside trackpad
\cite{1}. Samsung and Toshiba have also been making effort towards
backside touch input. With the growing interest in backside touch
input, comes the potential for using the same for entering and
manipulating information. A "natural" method of holding such a device
is to have hands on both the sides with fingers wrapped around on the
back (Figure~\ref{fig:natural}). Moreover, we feel that such devices can be used in various different scenarios. Some of these are outlined here. The user could be stationary and visually focused. This scenario is the best for QWERTY, as the user can optimize his configuration according to the requirements of the interface. Another one could be when the user is mobile but still visually focused. The challenge here is
that due to occasional loss of focus (for example while commuting) while entering the text, users
have to orient themselves again after each lapse. Such scenarios would
require mechanisms that don't necessarily require the user to
re-orient themselves time and again. Another example scenario is when the user is mobile and intermittently focused. These scenarios require mechanisms that could help the user memorize certain set patterns and configurations, that they could later replicate even without looking at the interface. Chording mechanisms generally fall in this category. We feel that devices with backside touch input have affordances that can support mechanisms that allow users to enter text in various different scenarios.

       screen in a natural and stable posture. The user is able to see
       his finger positions on the screen on the front. The figure
       also shows our hardware prototype with a multitouch screen on
       the rear of a Slate PC.}

Therefore, in this paper we investigate the use of a backside touch input device
for text input on a mobile device with a medium-sized touch
screen. Using a hardware prototype with a multitouch input on both the
back and the front of the device, we explore two new mechanisms: a
backside QWERTY keyboard, and a chording mechanism.  We study the
performance of these novel mechanisms with a standard soft QWERTY
keyboard by examining the quantitative and qualitative results of a
controlled, 36 user study, plus some auxiliary investigation.

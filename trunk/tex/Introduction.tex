\section{Introduction}

With the recent rise in sales in the smartphone/PDA market
and the recent launch of several tablet form-factor devices (Tablet PCs, Apple iPad, Amazon's Kindle), users increasingly use medium sized touch screens. These screens offer
more screen space than a traditional phone, and can arguably be more
effective in text-input tasks. Due to increased size and weight,
however, these devices require specific postures for the users to be
able to input text. Therefore, text entry on such devices continues to be a difficult problem.

As mentioned above, the tablet form-factor introduces two major problems for the user. 

Firstly, the larger form-factor makes it hard to type while not seated. Since a tablet is portable, it is an ideal device for use while mobile. By this we mean situations when the user is actually moving between different places, but mostly stationary. Commuters standing in a train are a good example of users who would benefit from using a computing device while standing, walking or sitting and briefly holding their device.

    \label{fig:device_hold}
\end{figure}
Unlike a mobile phone, however, a larger (e.g. 7+ inches wide)  keyboard (soft or otherwise) does not work well with two thumbs because of the relatively large distance that the thumbs must travel to reach the appropriate keys. The weight of the device compounds the problem of typing by straining the hands to support the device while making precise movements to position the thumbs over the proper keys. While standing, many users resort to a different pose, in which one arm supports the device while the other hand types with a single finger (Figure~\ref{fig:device_hold}). 

The second problem with tablet form-factor is that direct touch or pen input cause the issue of occlusion. Previous work suggests that such scenarios involve contortions of fingers and hands to achieve a configuration that allows for reading the screen while entering text. \cite{Vogel}

At the same time, there has recently been a push in the industry for
devices with ``backside'' or ``back-of-device'' input, in which the
device has a touch input device or keyboard on the opposite side of
the main display. Notion Ink's Adam PC has a back-of-device trackpad
[1]. Samsung and Sony have also been making effort towards back-of-device
touch input \cite{Samsung},\cite{Sony}. As manufacturers start to
include back-of-device input in their devices, we have an opportunity to
take advantage of this new input modality to improve the users speed,
accuracy and comfort while entering text on their tablet form-factor
devices. A ``natural'' method of holding such a device is to have hands
on both the sides with fingers wrapped around on the
back. \cite{Vogel} (Figure~\ref{fig:natural})

We believe that back-of-device interactions offer solutions to the
pose and grip problems mentioned above because the fingers naturally
rest on the back of the device while holding it, thereby relieving the
common problem of trying to hold a device with one hand while tapping
with the other (Figure~\ref{fig:device_hold}).  Back-of-device input
also keeps the fingers out of the main viewing area of the screen.
Users might find this particularly valuable when they are mobile and
visually focused, but occasionally losing focus while entering text
(for example while commuting on a train).  With a QWERTY keyboard,
users have to orient themselves again after each lapse. Such scenarios
can benefit from mechanisms that don't require the user to reorient
themselves when they lose focus.  Scenarios in which the user is only
intermittently focused, such as when they are walking, require
mechanisms that help the user memorize certain set patterns and
configurations of fingers, that they could later replicate even
without looking at the interface.

In this paper we present a novel text-input mechanism that can be used
on devices with back-of-device touch input, and we examine QWERTY
layouts on both the front and back of the device for comparison. The
goal is to provide mechanisms that could allow users to enter text on
devices with larger screens and back-of-device touch input in a way
that eliminates the problems of occlusion of screen space inherent to
touch and pen input, and uses the established effectiveness of
single-axis movements on back-of-device touch input \cite{Wobbrock} by
giving freedom of movement to multiple fingers.  Our work stands in
contrast to other recent work which requires additional hardware, such
as hover sensing \cite{LucidTouch} or discreet physical keys
\cite{RearType}.

We have designed a chording-based touch input mechanism specifically
for devices with a back-of-device touch input.  This mechanism shows
promise in the scenarios described above.  Figure~\ref{fig:natural}
illustrates that entering text on the back of the device results in a
more natural, comfortable and stable pose than the commonly adopted
pose shown in Figure~\ref{fig:device_hold}.  We designed the mechanism
to use large, relatively inaccurate finger movements as the building
block for chords.  This allows the user to exploit proprioceptive
feedback (e.g. the feedback from in the nervous system of the hands
that signals the relative positions of the fingers to one another) to
increase their speed and accuracy by reducing or eliminating the
visual feedback required to enter text. 

We also designed a back-of-device QWERTY mechanism that allows users
to use multiple fingers to manipulate multiple cursors.  We chose to
copy the QWERTY layout to help us destinguish between effects due to
using back-of-device input and effecs due to layout or mechanism
changes. Details on both the mechanisms can be found later in the
paper.

       screen in a natural and stable posture. The user is able to see
       his finger positions on the screen on the front. The figure
       also shows our hardware prototype with a multitouch screen on
       the rear of a Slate PC.}
        \label{fig:natural}
\end{figure*}

In this paper we detail our initial quantitative and qualitative
investigation of these new mechanisms. However, as in other
exploratory works \cite{RearType}, howwever, our focus for this phase
of experimentation is to determine if users find such input mechanisms
usable or frustrating, and to identify additional concerns with use of
back-of-device touch input, such as minimized grip stability. To
illuminate quser perception of back-of-device text-input, we use the
NASA Task Load Index (TLX) and present an analysis of the reported
user experience. Using a hardware prototype with a multitouch input on
both the back and the front of the device, we compare the performance
of the novel chording mechanism and a back-of-device QWERTY with a
standard soft QWERTY keyboard on the front or the back of the device
in a controlled, 36-user study. We found that with less than an hour
of training, users of the back-of-device QWERTY were able to type
3/4th as fast as soft-QWERTY.  The chording mechanism turned out to be
the most accurate mechanism, although reasonable input speed seems to
require more training time than the users were given.

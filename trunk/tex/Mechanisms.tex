\section{Mechanisms}

As mentioned earlier, we have implemented two backside touch input based
mechanisms and a standard soft-QWERTY keyboard. The details of each mechanisms 
follow:

\subsection{QWERTY}

This is a standard soft QWERTY keyboard, with no special
modifications. The keyboard supported multitouch, which means the
users could select the next character to be entered without releasing
the currently selected one. The keys turned blue on click, so that the
user gets appropriate feedback. The top quarter of the screen was a
scrollable textfield, which displayed the text that was being entered.

\subsection{Backside QWERTY}
\subsubsection{Description}

This mechanism uses the standard QWERTY layout, but with a few
modifications. In this mechanism, the user places his fingers on the
backside screen and it results in a cursor appearing on the front
screen at a location that is vertically above the touch point. This
way user can move multiple cursors at the same time, using multiple
fingers. To input a particular character, the user must select a
particular key with the cursor and then touch the front screen
anywhere to signal input. Figure 3 shows a user selecting a
character on the backside-QWERTY mechanism.

\subsubsection{Design evolution}

The interface went through two iterations before getting its final
shape. The first version used pressure as a method to signal
input. When the user increased the pressure on the backside input, an
character would be registered.  Unfortunately, pressure input on the
Stantum panels appears to be measured by measuring the size of the
contact point, rather than actually measuring pressure.  As such, the
pressure measurements are inaccurate and difficult to calibrate,
especially for the pinky finger. Also, usability tests suggested
that being able to control the amount of pressure being applied is
hard for users. Since the users were already applying some pressure to
drag the cursors around, it turned out to be confusing for them.

Therefore, the second version of the interface accepted a character as
input if the user released their finger over that character. However,
in this case, in order to not give input after the user has touched
the screen, the user needs to go to a section of the screen that has
no keys and then remove the touch/cursor. Also, the chances of giving
accidental inputs, by accidentally removing a finger increased
manyfold. Both these factors resulted in additional overhead in terms
of time and accuracy.

As a result we finally shifted to touching the front panel once the
character has been selected, as the method to signal input.

In the first version we had also modified the keyboard layout to match
the finger to key mappings on a QWERTY keyboard. However,
after the usability test, we realized that users were still doing
visual search for keys instead of using their pre-existing knowledge
of QWERTY. Therefore, a QWERTY layout in this case turned out to be
more predictable and usable.Moreover, the size of the Space, Backspace
and Enter keys was increased so that they are easy to select.

\subsection{Chording mechanism}
\subsubsection{Description}

\begin{figure*}

      Note that all three steps can be performed simultaneously, for
      proficient users.}
    \label{fig:chording_explaination}
\end{figure*} 

The lack of tactile feedback has often been cited as the primary
problem with touchscreen-based keyboards.  Tactile feedback allows a
user to move their hands around the keyboard without looking, and to
therefore focus on the text they are typing.  The chording mechanism
was designed to allow the user to exploit their proprioception (the
sense of the relative postions of one's body) rather than tactile
feedback, in order to form and exploit kinesthetic memory
(short-feedback memory in the nervous system that bypasses cognative
processing for repetative tasks, often called ``muscle-memory'').
Since gross motor movements provide better proprioception, the
mechanism was designed to reduce requirements for precise movement.

The chording mechanism only requires that the user extend and contract
their fingers (e.g. move their fingers in the horizontal axis in the
natural pose).  There are three regions for each hand, determined
exclusively by the distance from the edge of the screen.  In the left
hand, each region corresponds to a character class: upper-case,
lower-case or symbols.  Within these classes, the number of fingers
touching the region determines one of three subgroups in the class,
with nine characters in each subgroup.  The nine characters are broken
up into three groups, and an individual character is selected using
the same mechanism on the right hand
(Figure~\ref{fig:chording_explaination}).

In our implementation, the number of fingers activating a region is
indicated by color changes to the activated regions, in addition to
the translucent circles representing the location of the fingers.
The user can use these circles to position their fingers in the correct
locations.  They then touche anywhere on the front screen to
indicate a character input.  When the user is learning how to use the
chording mechanism, they can enter a character using the step-by-step
process described above.  As they become more familiar, however, then
can enter chords by touching the device with both hands, in the
correct location, simultaneously.

Similar to backside QWERTY and QWERTY, the top quarter of the screen
was a scrollable textfield, which displayed the text that was being
entered.

    \caption{Screenshot of chording mechanism with user's fingers on
      the backside screen trying to form a chord}
\end{figure} 
\subsubsection{Design Evolution}

Usability testing suggested that the finger sizes and areas in which
users can move comfortably vary a lot. Therefore, in the final version
the users were allowed to select from large/medium/small setting, that determined the width of the zones. Users, who had
smaller reach, could use these settings to optimize the area of
movement. Rest of the design changes pertained to the device itself (like pressure), and therefore the fixes were the same as backside-QWERTY.

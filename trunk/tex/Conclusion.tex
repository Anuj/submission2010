\section{Conclusion}
Over all, both the new mechanisms got a positive response from users. They were not very fast, as comparable to soft-QWERTY, but some sample measurements that we did suggest that they have the potential to be very effective if the user has enough time to learn how to operate them.  With many new tablet form-factor devices launching, some of them with backside touch input devices like trackpads, text input for devices like our prototype will be an increasingly important topic of investigation.  These early results hint at many compelling directions for research on a fascinating and new mode of interaction.

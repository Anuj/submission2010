\section{Prototype}

\subsection{Hardware implementation}

In order to explore back-of-device touch input on tablets we created our hardware prototype using a Stantum Slate PC and a Stantum multitouch panel [Figure 2]. The multitouch panel was fixed on the back of the Slate PC. This produced the same setup as a tablet with a backside touch input. As a result we had a prototype that the user could hold with both hands wrapped around the sides, with fingers at the back. The user could touch on the multitouch panel to instantiate a corresponding cursor on the Slate PC. Cursors were semi-transparent circles that appeared on the screen at a location that was vertically above the point that the user touched on the multitouch panel at the back. This helped users keep a track of their finger movement. (Figure~\ref{fig:natural})

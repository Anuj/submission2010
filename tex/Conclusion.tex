\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we think that both the new mechanisms got a positive response. They were not very fast, as comparable to soft-QWERTY, but they did come close and some sample measurements that we did also suggest that they have the potential to be even more effective given that the user gets enough time to get accustomed. We believe that with more and more devices being launched in the domain, and with more of them shipping with backside touch input devices like trackpads, and even screens, the problem under question in this paper will become well investigated. Our efforts were just the first few steps towards the same.
